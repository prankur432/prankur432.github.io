  - title: "You Want What You Get: The Effect of Realized Fertility on Fertility Preference"
    abstract: "Fertility preferences are critical in understanding fertility trends and in making reproductive policies. However, if fertility itself influences survey reports of preferences, then its usage in policy making gets complicated. This paper investigates whether there exists a causal effect of realized fertility on desired fertility. I exploit two separate sources of exogenous variation in realized fertility, robustly implementing two distinct identification strategies. The first uses the occurrence of twins while the second uses the birth of a female child at first birth to estimate the impact of realized fertility on desired fertility. Using data from 230 rounds of Demographic and Health Surveys from 74 developing countries, I find that having an additional birth causally increases desired fertility by 0.15-0.30. My main result is to identify this causal effect, but my data also allow me to investigate probable mechanism.  I show that facts of timing rule out learning that could be consistent with a classical model of causally-prior preferences.  Instead, supplementary evidence suggests a behavioral mechanism whereby outcomes influence stated preferences, which could be through reference-dependent preferences, ex-post rationalization, or another behavioral mechanism. The result has important policy and research implications specifically when using fertility preferences to estimate excess fertility, the need for family planning programs, son preference, or as proxies for intrahousehold bargaining."

  - title: "Large and unequal life expectancy declines associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in India in 2020"
    coauthors: "Aashish Gupta, Payal Hathi, Sangita Vyas and 6 others"
    abstract: "The toll of the COVID-19 pandemic in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is uncertain. We are the first to use high-quality empirical data from India, which has a large population and where pandemic surveillance was particularly poor, to examine changes in life expectancy and estimate excess deaths during the pandemic. We analyze data from the households interviewed in 2021 in India's fifth Demographic and Health Survey, a subsample representative of about one-quarter of India's population. In this subsample, life expectancy at birth declined by 2.6 years between 2019 and 2020, a reduction that is larger than the loss in life expectancy observed in any high-income country (HIC) in the same period. Mortality was 17.0% higher in the pandemic months of 2020 compared to 2019. Applied nationally, this level of excess mortality implies 1.18 million excess deaths in 2020. Compared to HICs, mortality increases in younger ages in India contributed more to the decrease in life expectancy than older ages. Furthermore, the pandemic exacerbated gender and social inequalities. In contrast to global patterns, females in India experienced larger life expectancy losses than males. As compared to a life expectancy loss of 1.5 years for high caste Hindus, who are privileged in Indian society, Muslims lost 5.9 years, Scheduled Tribes lost 4.4 years, and Scheduled Castes lost 2.6 years. These findings uncover large and unequal mortality shocks during the pandemic in the world's most populous country"
