Hello there! I am Prankur Gupta, a PhD Candidate in Economics at The University of Texas at Austin. I am an Applied Microeconomist and use different causal inference tools to answer questions in the areas of Development Economics and Economic Demography. My <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prankur432/public-docs/main/DesiredFertility_Gupta_JMP.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">job market paper</a> explores the effect of realized fertility on fertility preferences. A separate strand of my research focuses on the impact of unconditional cash transfers in low income contexts.

I would be on the 2023-24 job market.
