Hello there! I am Prankur Gupta, a PhD Candidate in Economics at The University of Texas at Austin. I am an Applied Microeconomist and use different causal inference tools to answer question in the areas of Development Economics and Economic Demography. My job market paper explores the effect of realized fertility on fertility preferences. A separate strand of my research focuses on the impact of unconditional cash transfers in low income contexts.

I would be on the 2023-24 job market.
